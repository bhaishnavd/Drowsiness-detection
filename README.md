# Drowsiness-detection 😴
CNN-based Drowsiness Detection using OpenCV and TensorFlow – Detects if a person’s eyes are closed or open in real-time using a webcam to alert drowsy drivers


A **real-time drowsiness detection** application that monitors eye state (open/closed) using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** and alerts when drowsiness is detected — ideal for preventing accidents caused by sleepy driving.

## Features ✅
- Real-time eye monitoring through webcam  
- CNN-based eye state classification (Open / Closed)  
- Audio alert when drowsiness is detected  
- Easy to train and extend with custom datasets  

## Technologies Used 🛠
- **Python** – Main programming language  
- **OpenCV** – For face and eye detection  
- **TensorFlow / Keras** – For CNN model training and prediction  
- **NumPy** – Data processing  
- **Streamlit ** – GUI interface for easy usage  

## Installation 💻
1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bhaishnavd/drowsiness-detection.git
cd drowsiness-detection
